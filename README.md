# Student Score Predictor (Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict student test scores based on study hours. It progresses from simple hardcoded data to real-world CSV data, predictions, plotting, and model evaluation.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Trains a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Loads and processes real CSV data
- Makes predictions based on new inputs
- Visualizes data and trend lines with `matplotlib`
- Splits data into train/test sets and evaluates accuracy

## ðŸ“„ Files

- `ML2.py`: Basic linear regression with hardcoded values
- `csv_plot.py`: Loads data from CSV and plots it
- `csv_linear_predict.py`: Trains a model on CSV data and predicts scores with a plotted regression line
- `csv_split_accuracy.py`: Splits the dataset into training/testing sets and prints prediction accuracy metrics

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install with:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
